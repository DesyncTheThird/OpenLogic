\olsection{Introduction}

!!^{tableau}s are certain (downward-branching) trees of !!{signed
  formula}s, i.e., pairs consisting of a truth value sign ($\True$ or
$\False$) and !!a{sentence}
\[
\sFmla{\True}{!A} \text{ or } \sFmla{\False}{!A}.
\]
!!^a{tableau} begins with a number of \emph{assumptions}. Each further
!!{signed formula} is generated by applying one of the inference
rules. Some inference rules add one or more !!{signed formula}s to a
tip of the tree; others add two new tips, resulting in two branches.
Rules result in !!{signed formula}s where the !!{formula} is
less complex than that of the !!{signed formula} to which it was
applied. When a branch contains both $\sFmla{\True}{!A}$ and
$\sFmla{\False}{!A}$, we say the branch is \emph{closed}. If every
branch in !!a{tableau} is closed, the entire !!{tableau} is closed. A
closed !!{tableau} constitutes !!a{derivation} that shows that the set
of !!{signed formula}s which were used to begin the !!{tableau} are
unsatisfiable.  This can be used to define a $\Proves$ relation:
$\Gamma \Proves !A$ iff there is some finite set~$\Gamma_0 = \{!B_1,
\dots, !B_n\} \subseteq \Gamma$ such that there is a closed
!!{tableau} for the assumptions
\[
\{\sFmla{\False}{!A}, \sFmla{\True}{!B_1}, \dots, \sFmla{\True}{!B_n}\}.
\]

For intuitionistic logic, we have to both extend the notion of
!!{signed formula} and adjust the rules for the connectives. In
addition to a sign($\True$ or $\False$), !!{formula}s in modal
!!{tableau}s also have \emph{prefixes}~$\sigma$. The prefixes are
non-empty sequences of positive integers, i.e., $\sigma \in
(\PosInt)^* \setminus \{\emptyseq\}$. When we write such prefixes
without the surrounding $\tuple{\ }$, and separate the individual
!!{element}s by~$.$'s instead of $,$'s. If $\sigma$ is a prefix, then
$\sigma.n$ is $\sigma \concat \tuple{n}$; e.g., if $\sigma = 1.2.1$,
then $\sigma.3$ is $1.2.1.3$. So for instance,
\[
\sFmla{\True}{!A \lif (!B \lif !C)}[1.2]
\]
is a \emph{prefixed !!{signed formula}} (or just a \emph{prefixed
  !!{formula}} for short).

Intuitively, the prefix names a world in a model that might satisfy
the !!{formula}s on a branch of !!a{tableau}, and if $\sigma$ names
some world, then $\sigma.n$ names a world accessible from (the world
named by)~$\sigma$.

In intuitionistic models, the accessibility relation is reflexive and
transitive. In terms of prefixes, this means that $\sigma$ is
accessible from $\sigma$ itself, and so is any prefix that
extends~$\sigma$, i.e., any prefix of the form
$\sigma.n_1.\cdots.n_k$. Let's introduce the notation $\sigma.*$ to
indicate $\sigma$ itself and any extension of it. In other words, the
prefixes $\sigma.*$ are all and only the prefixes accessible
from~$\sigma$.
